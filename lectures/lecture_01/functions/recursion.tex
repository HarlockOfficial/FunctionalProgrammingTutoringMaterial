\begin{frame}{Recursion}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Recursion is a technique in which a \textbf{function calls itself} as a subroutine or where a \textbf{set of functions call each other in a circular chain}.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Base Case (Not mandatory, but highly recommended)}
        A recursive function should have a base case that terminates the recursion.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Self-Recursive Case}
        A recursive function can have a recursive case that calls itself, hopefully with a modified (smaller) input.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Circular Recursion}
        A recursive function can have a case where calls another function, which in turn may call other functions that call the first one.
    \end{block}
